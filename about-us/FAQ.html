                <div id="title">Frequently Asked Questions</div><br>
                <span class="header">Where do our animals come from?
</span><br>
                <p>Our animals are rescued from the streets of Arizona, high kill shelters, owner relinquished, unclaimed strays,  Indian reservation’s, Mexico and surrounding states including Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and California.  We also do mission work and take animals off the Island of Puerto Rico throughout the year.  
</p>

              <span class="header">Are your cats and dogs neutered/spayed before adoption?
</span><br>
                <p>All of our cats and dogs are neutered/spayed before final adoption.</p>

<span class="header">What does your adoption donation/fee cover?
</span><br>

		<p>
			The adoption donation covers vetting from intake through date of final adoption to include all applicable vaccines, medical care, food, supplements, microchip for dogs and various other necessities required to make them adoptable for their loving forever home.  It is the adopter’s responsibility to set up ongoing veterinary care for the adopted animal for yearly checkups, any outstanding vaccines which are required after adoption, and for emergency situations.  Your new furry friend needs to know that all their medical needs will be taken care of for their entire lifespan.

<span class="header">Do you adopt outside of the Phoenix metro area?

</span><br>
		<p>
			Under certain circumstances, if your home is the "perfect home", we will 			place a pet in a home outside of the Phoenix metro area.
		</p>





		   <span class="header">Can I try a pet in my home before finalizing the adoption?

<span class="header">Why Does My Cat & Dog Eat Poop?





</span><br>
                <p>Of all the repulsive habits our dogs have—drinking from the toilet, rolling in swamp muck, licking their butts— nothing tops the disgusting practice of dogs eating poop. Their motivation may not be to gross us humans out, but it certainly does. So much so, in fact, that poop eating is often a reason people try to rehome a dog or even opt for euthanasia.
</p>
<p>
There’s a scientific name for this habit— coprophagia (kop-ruh-fey-jee-uh)—and also both behavioral and physiological reasons why some dogs view dung as a delicacy. If you have a poop eater, don’t despair. There are ways to discourage the habit. Although not deeply probed by science — there are few studies on it — poop eating is a relatively common phenomenon. In a 2012 study presented at the American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior annual conference, researchers led by Dr. Benjamin Hart, from the University of California, Davis, found that:
</p>
<ul>

<li>16 percent (one in six) of dogs are classified as “serious” stool eaters, which means that they were caught in the act five times</li>

<li>24 percent of the dogs in the study (one in four) were observed eating feces at least once.</li>

</ul>
