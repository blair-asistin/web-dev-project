                <p>My name is Ro Perez and I am the CEO/Founder of Saving Orphan Souls Rescue, a 501c3 Non-Profit Cat/Small Dog Rescue based out of Glendale, Arizona. My goal, along with my volunteers and fosters, is to make a difference in each and every life that comes through our doors by showing them what LOVE and being cared for is all about.  As a rescue, we cut no corners and provide extensive medical care, high quality food, supplements, toys, socialization and lots of time and love for each and every animal.</p>
                <p>Saving Orphan Souls Rescue is a no kill organization, and all our animals are placed into foster care while they await their "furever homes".  All our foster homes are thoroughly screened, and unannounced home checks are done to ensure our animals are being  well taken care of at all times.  Our animals are introduced to other dogs, cats and children to ensure there are no behavioral issues, and we can place them with the correct adopters.  Any animal that comes into our rescue is thoroughly assessed, vet checked and given ample time to adjust to their new surroundings so we can properly evaluate them. Our fosters provide  a ton of love and compassion to these animals to ensure they become well rounded, and will make an outstanding family pet. </p>
		<p>Saving Orphan Souls Rescue is passionate about the homeless animals on the streets of Arizona. However, that same passion extends to members of the human community and we are glad to extend a helping hand to anyone in need by providing much needed supplies and owner education. Our rescue efforts extend beyond the borders of Arizona and we will take in animals from other states who are in dire need of rescuing.  We partner with affiliates in Mexico, Puerto Rico, Utah and other surrounding states. Our goal is to get animals out of hoarding situations, puppy mills, off the streets of Mexico, and to give cats from Puerto Rico a chance to find a forever home.  Without rescue from the island, they would only have a 10% likelihood of finding a loving home.  </p>
                    <p>No matter the situation, we are always ready, willing and able to help these innocent lives.</p>

            <span class="header">Our Mission</span>

            <div id="MissionStatement">
                <div>
                    <p>Saving Orphan Souls Rescue is run by an outstanding team of volunteers, fosters and directors who take the animals best interest to heart at all times.  Their love and passion for animals is heartwarming, and any animal who passes through our doors, receives exceptional medical care, socialization, unconditional love, and a warm and clean foster home to relax while they wait for their forever homes. </p>
                    <p>At Saving Orphan Souls Rescue, our mission is to empower and educate our community on low cost options regarding spay/neuter/vaccines/microchip of all animals.  Our goal is to work diligently to end the cycle of breeding/over population, relinquishing animals, abandonment, leaving them tethered in the back yard with no social interaction, and allowing the pets in Arizona to run free causing unending suffering.</p>

                    <p>Saving Orphan Souls Rescue works in conjunction with our community to help reduce the euthanasia rate by educating the public on the utmost importance and benefits of spay/neuter clinics, along with immunization and licensing services offered by various entities throughout Maricopa County.</p>

<p>Please send an email to:  savingorphansouls@yahoo.com for further information, and help us reduce the overpopulation epidemic here in Arizona.</p>

<p>In addition to helping the abandoned animals in our care, we try to give back to the community.  Saving Orphan Souls Rescue often runs clothing and food drives for the homeless AND their pets.  We collect socks, shoes, pants, shirts, etc, as well as leashes, collars, harnesses, food, treats and booties for the dogs of the homeless and the working poor.  We try to involve the entire metro community, because homelessness effects us all in some way.  Families who could otherwise not afford to keep their pets, are provided resources for food and low cost medical options for their furry friend. </p>
