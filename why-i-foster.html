                                My name is Susan, and I foster cats and kittens for Saving Orphan Souls Rescue.  I take in pregnant moms, kittens without moms, sick, injured, unfriendly and scared kitties.  What does fostering mean to me?  It means that I get to help the ones that are scared, or have been left behind. I comfort them and let them feel love. I help save their life from living on the streets and so they don't end up there. I feel good that i had a part in their new life, that I’ve taken part in a pregnant mom giving birth, and seeing a new life being born. Sometimes they don't make it, no matter how hard you tried saving that life. It can be hard at times, but the ones that do make it, makes it  worth doing again and again. Watching them grow up, when that time comes for them to get adopted - it's hard to let them go after having them for a few months. But I'm happy for them. I foster get baby kittens with no moms, or they are sick and I nurse them back to health. Then there are the ones that are not friendly or scared and you need to work with them, teach them trust you, and that not all people are bad, so they arenot afraid. Have patience with them, so they can be adoptable. It can be challenging when you work full time and foster, but I will keep fostering until my body says no more. I love what I do.

                            <blockquote><em>
                                Each foster gives me something amazing in return, whether it be love, happiness or gratification. Each foster comes with their own personality and sometimes sets of problems that I get to explore and mold into something better for them. Watching an animal grow trust in you and them realizing how amazing simple things are like getting pets or treats, is for me a sense of accomplishment. I love watching them grow, their little fears pushed aside, finding friendships with other animals and becoming confident with themselves and their surroundings. I get the blessing of loving and caring for them unconditionally as if they were mine. Yes, it is bittersweet whene they find a home; but knowing that animal will make their newowners very happy and that they themselves will be happy and cared for is an amazing feeling. When a new animal comes into my home they become part of my family, they deserve love and kindness becausetheir life before coming into mine may not have been very good.

                            <blockquote><em>
                                Today, I sent my foster cat Ava May off to her forever home.   Ava came to us with her week old kittens, and after they were adopted, she waited and waited for her turn at forever.  But Ava didn’t do well at adoptions.  She was frightened of all the sounds and smells, and cowered in her crate.  She growled and hissed at everyone who attempted to pet her, or show her any kind of love or attention.   Why do I foster?  So that cats like Ava May can have a place they feel safe and loved while they wait for their new families to find them.  I foster because that makes room to save one more life.  I foster because I love cats and dogs and to see them wait in the chaos of a shelter environment breaks my heart.  I foster because if I didn’t, cats like Ava May - timid, shy but loving and affectionate cats  - would not find forever.  Instead they would live out their lives on the street, running from people chasing them off, having litter after litter of kittens, and eventually dying a lonely and often painful death.  If they are lucky enough to be picked up by a shelter, they still have little hope of finding forever- there are just too many.  So I foster.  One cat is alive and safe in a wonderful forever home tonite, because I foster.

                            <blockquote><em>
                                Three little kittens came to my house the first time I fostered. I was scared and timid. Little did I know that the kittens were just as scared as I was. I knew quickly that my job was not only to give them food and clean their litter boxes but to also help them feel comfortable and loved. And then I was hooked! It’s very exciting when you are presented with one or many cats ready for fostering. You get to see their personalities, what part of them likes to be rubbed, and who can purr the loudest. A lot of cats and kittens have not had an easy life thus far and if I can make them feel better for a few days or sometimes a few months, it is so worthwhile. Knowing that I had a part in getting these cats ready for adoption to a ‘furever’ home is most gratifying. The Saving Orphan Souls Rescue team is professional and cares deeply about the animals they are involved with. Everyone works together as we have the same goals. I feel lucky that I became involved with them,  and if anyone is thinking about giving some of their time to volunteer in the future, I would certainly recommend Saving Orphan Souls Rescue.
